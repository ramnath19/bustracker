# bustracker

This is a map project for my MERN MIT xPro Full Stack Developer course. The goal was to use a real-time API with data about the location of various public transport buses, then show them moving on the map. I was successful in using the API data from Boston but I'm still working on making it work with a Chicago API.

To run this map on your own machine, clone this repo using your terminal:

Navigate to: (https://github.com/ramnath19/bustracker/main)
Click on the green "Code" button, then from the HTTPS menu, copy the url.
Go to your Terminal on your local machine. Navigate to whichever directory you would like the bus tracker to be saved in.
Type "git clone" followed by pasting in the URL you got in step 2.
Hit enter and you will have created your local clone. Run the files in VS Code.
